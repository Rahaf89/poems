<!-- This paragraph is based on the Wikipedia article -->
 <p id="Khalil-Gibran"> <em> Was a Lebanese-American writer, poet and visual artist, also considered a philosopher although he himself rejected this title in his lifetime. He is best known as the author of  <strong>The Prophet </strong>, which was  <strong>first published in the United States </strong> in  <strong>1923 </strong> and is one of the best-selling books of all time, having been translated into dozens of languages.<br> 
      Born in a village of the Ottoman-ruled Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate to a Maronite Christian family, the young Gibran immigrated with his mother and siblings to the <strong> United States </strong> in <strong>1895.</strong> As his mother worked as a seamstress, he was enrolled at a school in Boston, where his creative abilities were quickly noticed by a teacher who presented him to Fred Holland Day. Gibran was sent back to his native land by his family at the age of fifteen to enroll at <strong>al-Hikma School </strong> in <strong>Beirut.</strong> Returning to Boston upon his youngest sister's death in 1902, he lost his older half-brother and his mother the following year, seemingly relying afterwards on his remaining sister's income from her work at a dressmaker's shop for some time.</em></p></div>

  <h3 id="A tear"> A Tear And A Smile </h3>

  <p> I would not exchange the sorrows of my hear<br> For the joys of the multitude.<br> And I would not have the tears that sadness makes<br> To flow from my every part turn into laughter.<br> </p>

  <p>I would that my life remain a tear and a smile.<br> </p>

  <p>A tear to purify my heart and give me understanding<br> Of life's secrets and hidden things.<br> A smile to draw me nigh to the sons of my kind and<br> To be a symbol of my glorification of the gods.</p>
  <p>
    A tear to unite me with those of broken heart;<br> A smile to be a sign of my joy in existence.
  </p>

  <p>I would rather that I died in yearning and longing <br>than that I live Weary and despairing.<br></p>

  <p>I want the hunger for love and beauty to be in the<br> Depths of my spirit,for I have seen those who are<br> Satisfied the most wretched of people.<br> I have heard the sigh of those in yearning and Longing, and it is sweeter<br> than the sweetest melody.<br></p3>

    <p>With evening's coming the flower folds her petals<br> And sleeps, embracingher longing.<br> At morning's approach she opens her lips to meet<br> The sun's kiss.<br>
    </p>
